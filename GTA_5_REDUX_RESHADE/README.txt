# Reshade 3.1 tutorial for Redux

Ensure you have a fresh install of GTA V

Download Reshade from https://reshade.me

Run the Reshade Setup executable

Select your GTA V folder

Click on Direct3D 10+

If it asks you to download a collection of effects, hit yes and then ok. Let it install everything it selected by default.

Now you can just close the program.

Copy all of the files from the folder that this readme file is in to your GTA V folder.

Run GTA V and in the menus, Shift+F2 and make sure that it lists a bunch of effects after doing what it prompts.

If it lists a large amount of effects on the screen, then you have successfuly installed Reshade 3.1. BUT, you haven't enabled anything.

Look for a + sign on the right of the menu. There is a drop down arrow right next to it where you can select presets from. Once you have done that, reload the menu to be sure that it has been loaded.

It's now fully installed and you can change presets at any time! If your FPS is low, go into the settings tab and change the mode from configuration to performance.

# Troubleshooting

No effects are showing up in the menu:
Delete your reshae-shaders folder in the GTA V folder and go to https://github.com/crosire/reshade-shaders and follow the instructions at the bottom of the page

I have messed up my shaders! How do I return them to default?
Delete the ini file from the game folder and put in the default one from where you got it

If you find any bugs or encounter any problems, tell how you installed it and when it crashes to Lord Tachanka on the Redux Discord Server
